# Contributing to Cog

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Cog. We are grateful for contributions of all kinds; reporting issues, updating documentation, fixing bugs, implementing new features, and any other type of contribution is hugely beneficial to Cog and our community. We're excited to see what you come up with!

Before submitting your contribution, please review the following guidelines. These are intended to make the contribution process as simple and predictable as possible for both contributors and project maintainers.

## Code of Conduct

All Operable sponsored projects require contributors to behave in accordance with our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/operable/cog/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) which is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/). Please report any behavior that violates the code of conduct to [founders@operable.io](mailto:founders@operable.io) so that we can investigate and take action as necessary.

## Pull Request Workflow

1. Fork the project repository and create a topic branch in your fork for your work. This fork should almost always be made against the `master` branch of the project you're working on, unless you have previously discussed basing your changes on a different branch with the Operable team.
2. Make your changes, including any necessary tests to cover new features or fixes that you make.
3. Ensure that all tests pass.
4. Submit a Pull Request against the `master` branch of the project you're working on.
5. The project committers review pull requests regularly and will work with contributors to provide feedback and guidance around any changes that are required before the pull request can be accepted.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

All contributions that do not fall within the Trivial Patch Exemption guidelines below require a [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/operable/cog/wiki/Contributor-License-Agreement) to be signed in order be considered.

## Trivial Patches

All patches that involve creative work are protectable under a copyright, so we require a CLA to be on file.

If your patch is extremely small (generally fewer than 10 lines) and does not introduce new functionality, it may be accepted without a CLA. In some cases, changes may be deemed Trivial even if they are longer than 10 lines if they are obvious changes such as minor documentation fixes, build script updates, configuration changes, and reordering of existing code. We review all pull requests to determine whether they require a CLA before merging and will let you know if you need to complete one.
